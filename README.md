**study** -- Snippets of code resulting of studying specific data structures, algorithms and general coding techniques.

## Requirements (sort of)
Not really mandatory, but I use the following tools, and perhaps more and I'm
forgetting:
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/)
