###Â study
Snippets of code resulting of studying specific data structures, algorithms and
general coding techniques.

### Requirements (sort of)
Not really mandatory, but I use the following tools, and perhaps more and I'm
forgetting. It's likely that I'm using the latest version of everything, though
my code is probably compatible with previous versions as well.
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/)
* [boost](http://www.boost.org/)
